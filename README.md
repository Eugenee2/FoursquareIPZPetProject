## Foursquare_clone_app


Foursquare_clone_app is my pet-project. This is a stripped-down version of the Foursquare app with some of my functionality different from the original version.
The application is based on the MVC pattern. The project is divided into modules that are implemented through a router. Also worked in practice with Networking, CoreLocation, MapKit, Keychain.
